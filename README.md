## Rad Orbits

### Abstract

This study presents a novel approach to designing satellite constellations optimized for maximum passage through high-radiation zones, 
offering essential insights into radiation effects on embedded systems. The methodology focuses on evaluating impacts on missions 
equipped with inter-satellite links (ISLs) and tailoring orbital paths to study radiation resilience and system performance in such environments. 
The proposed adaptive design employs polygon-based algorithms [1], leveraging a gradient descent approach [2] to achieve optimal constellation 
configurations. The methodology allows customization based on radiation zone characteristics, which vary by altitude, type of radiation particle, 
and temporal changes in radiation intensity. The flexibility of the approach accepts any dataset for radiation area modeling, 
offering an adaptable tool for the study of radiation impacts. Two use cases are presented: a single-satellite mission 
and a dual-satellite mission to evaluate ISL radiation effects. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the 
proposed approach in covering radiation-prone regions with different densities, offering valuable data for radiation studies in space environments.
